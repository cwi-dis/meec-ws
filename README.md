## Usage

### Installation via bundler

The recommended way of performing a local build is by using the Ruby package (gem) manager [bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/ "Official documentation on how to set up Jekyll locally using bundler").
Execute `bundler` in the root of the project to automatically install the necessary packages listed in the file `Gemfile`.
With the necessary dependencies installed, you should be able to use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to locally preview the project.

### OS-wide Jekyll installation

Make sure that you have all of the gems installed this project depends on.
You can find the package (gem) names of these dependencies at the end of the file `Gemfile`.
With the necessary dependencies installed, you should be able to use `jekyll serve` to locally preview the project.
