__Title:__
Monitoring the dynamics of real life using ambulatory assessment

__Abstract:__
Real-time mobile smartphone sampling of psychopathological symptoms and behaviour, sometimes also called Ambulatory Assessment, has become more and more popular, offering three key advantages: 1) Real time assessment eliminates retrospective biases. 2) Real life assessment enables to investigate symptomatology in the most important context: the everyday life's of our patients. 3) The within-subject perspective offers the possibility to elucidate psychopathological mechanisms in everyday life. According to current research, the dynamics of affective states and the intentional regulation of emotions are even more important to psychological health and maladjustment, than the affective states itself. However, capturing the ebb and flow in everyday life is not trivial. Recent technical developments resulted in both fancy hardware to collect data in everyday life and powerful data modelling techniques to analyze it. All three advantages come with the promise of increasing validity and reliability and therewith decreasing costs and sample size for future studies. In my talk, I will focus on four examples of Ambulatory Assessment to illustrate opportunities in psychological research: a) utilizing high frequency data assessment to model affective dynamics, b) using location-triggered e-diaries to investigate the relation between stress-reactivity and environmental components, c) monitoring physical activity and telecommunication behaviour to predict upcoming episodes in bipolar patients. I will conclude my talk on specifying disadvantages and pitfalls of Ambulatory Assessment. In conclusion, Ambulatory Assessment does offer a wealth of methodological approaches to enhance the understanding of psychopathological symptoms in the most important context: the daily life's of our patients.

__Title:__
Emotions in time: the temporal unity of emotion phenomenology

__Abstract:__
According to componential theories of emotional experience, emotional experiences are phenomenally complex in that they consist of experiential parts, which may include cognitive appraisals, bodily feelings and action tendencies.
These componential theories face the problem of emotional unity: despite their complexity, emotional experiences also seem to be phenomenologically unified.
Componential theories have to give an account of this unity.
We argue that existing accounts of emotional unity fail and that instead emotional unity is an instance of experienced causal-temporal unity.
We propose that felt emotional unity arises from our experience of the temporal-causal order of the world.
Emotions are unified since their components appear to occur simultaneously and as having a common causal origin.

__Bio of Kris Goffin:__
I am a philosopher.
My research focuses on philosophy of mind, philosophy of cognitive science, emotion theory, and aesthetics.
I mainly work on emotions, art and implicit attitudes, such as implicit racist and sexist prejudices and stereotypes.
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at UAntwerp and KULeuven.
In October 2019, I started doing interdisciplinary research with a team of social psychologists from Agnes Moors' Lab at KULeuven on implicit bias and implicit racism.
I received a Postdoctoral Fellowship from the FWO (Flemish Research Foundation).

__Bio of Gerardo Viera:__
I'm a lecturer (the UK equivalent of an assistant professor) in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield specializing in the philosophy of cognitive science and mind I am also an associate director of the Hang Seng Centre for Cognitive Studies.
In my work I try and understand how creatures like us come to think about and perceive time.
I also study issues in the philosophy of cognitive science more generally (esp. issues regarding mental representation), philosophy of science (esp. kinds in cognitive science), philosophy of language, and metaphysics.
At Sheffield I teach modules in the philosophy of science, epistemology, and philosophy of cognitive science (also as part of the Cognitive Studies program).

__Title:__
The heart as a subjective pacemaker: how experienced time expands and contracts within each heartbeat

__Abstract:__
The experience of time is highly subjective.
When we stare at the hands of a clock, a minute can feel much longer than when we are swept up in a fun activity.
How this subjective experience of time arises is a hotly debated issue.
Here, we focus on the role of the heart, whose activity provides a continuous background to all information processing.
To study the causal influence of cardiac signals, we present timed stimuli (a shape, and auditory beep, a fearful or a happy face) either during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, when the heart contracts or during the diastolic phase, when the heart relaxes.
We find that physically identical stimulus durations are perceived shorter during heart's contraction but longer during heart's relaxation.
Time contracts and expands within each heartbeat like an accordion.
But we also find that this cardiac effect on time is further modulated by experienced arousal, explaining why time may speed up in high arousal situations.

__Bio:__
During my undergraduate Psychology degree at City, University of London I was examining emotion/body perception and embodiment (under the supervision of Prof Bettina Forster).
Specifically, how we engage our own internal body representation when trying to understand others.
My PhD (UCL with Prof Patrick Haggard) was about touch and how we piece together distinct inputs from the skin so that our experience of touched objects is unified rather than fragmented.
I am now a postdoctoral researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London in a lab led by Prof Manos Tsakiris, where my main interest is how our internal states (changes in the heart) influence how we experience elapsing time.
